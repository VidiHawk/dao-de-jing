大道废，有仁义；

When the great Way perishes, there is humaneness and justice.

慧智出，有大伪；

When intelligence is manifest, there is great deception.

六亲不和，有孝慈；

When the six relationships are not in harmony. there is filial piety and compassion.

国家昏乱，有忠臣。

When the country is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.
