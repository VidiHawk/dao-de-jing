天长地久。

The cosmos is infinite and timeless.

天地所以能长且久者，

It is because the cosmos can both be infinite and timeless,

以其不自生，

That it did not foster itself.

故能长生。

Thus it can be infinite.

是以圣人后其身而身先，

The sage puts himself last, and thus is first,

外其身而身存。

He detaches himself, and thus is united.

非以其无私邪？

Is he not selfless?

故能成其私。

This is precisely the cause of his fulfillment.
