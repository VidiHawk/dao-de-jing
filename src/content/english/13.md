宠辱若惊，

Accept humiliation as a surprise,

贵大患若身。

Value great illness as your own self.

何谓宠辱若惊？

What do I mean by "Accept humiliation as a surprise"?

宠为下，得之若惊，

When you are humble, attainment is construed as a surprise,

失之若惊，

And so is loss,

是谓宠辱若惊。

Thus, I say "Accept humiliation as a surprise".

何谓贵大患若身？

What do I mean by "Value great illness as your own self"?

吾所以有大患者，

If I have a great illness,

为吾有身，及吾无身，

Hence I have a body, and if I have no body,

吾有何患！

How can I be ill!

故贵以身为天下，

Consequently, valuing your body in accordance with the world,

若可寄天下；

Is alike entangling yourself with the world;

爱以身为天下，

Loving your body in accordance with the world,

若可托天下。

Is alike entrusting yourself with the world.
