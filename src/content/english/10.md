载营魄抱一，

Manage to unite your soul and body,

能无离乎？

Can they avoid separation?

专气致柔，

Make your breathing soft,

能婴儿乎？

Can that make you a newborn child?

涤除玄览，

Cleanse your dark thoughts,

能无疵乎？

Can it make you flawless?

爱民治国，

Love people and govern your country,

能无知乎？

Can you avoid over-manipulation?

天门开阖，

As the mysterious gate opens and closes,

能无雌乎？

Can you be impassive?

明白四达，

As your understanding reaches everywhere,

能无为乎？

Can you refrain from striving?

生之、畜之，

Create it, foster it,

生而不有，

Live without possessing,

为而不恃，

Act without expecting,

长而不宰，

Lead without domineering,

是谓玄德。

This is called the mysterious virtue.
