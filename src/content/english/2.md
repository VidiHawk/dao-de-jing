天下皆知美之为美， 斯恶已,

All in the world recognize the beautiful as beautiful. Herein lies
ugliness.

皆知善不为善，斯不善已。

All recognize the good as good. Herein lies evil.

故有无相生， 难易相成，

Therefore Presence and absence produce each other. Difficulty and ease
bring about each other.

长短相较， 高下相倾，

Long and short delimit each other. High and low rest on each other.

音声想和，前后相随。

Sound and voice harmonize each other. Front and back follow each other.

是以圣人处无为之事，

Therefore the sage abides in the condition of wu-wei (unattached action).

行不言之教，万物作焉而不辞。

And carries out the wordless teaching. Here, the myriad things are made,
yet not separated.

生而不有，为而不恃，

Therefore the sage produces without possessing, Acts without expectations

功成而弗居，夫唯弗居，

And accomplishes without abiding in her accomplishments. It is precisely
because she does not abide in them

是以不去。

That they never leave her.
