天下皆知美之为美， 斯恶已,

People on Earth have defined beautiful as beautiful, and thus they created ugliness.

皆知善不为善，斯不善已。

They have defined the good as good, and thus they created evil.

故有无相生， 难易相成，

Therefore presence and absence produce each other. Difficulty and ease
bring about each other.

长短相较， 高下相倾，

Long and short delimit each other. High and low contrast with each other.

音声想和，前后相随。

Sound and noise harmonize each other. Front and back follow each other.

是以圣人处无为之事，

Thus the sage puts himself in a position of non-active productive state,

行不言之教，万物作焉而不辞。

Carries out unspoken guidance. The myriad things conform to the same law, without a word.

生而不有，为而不恃，

Living without possessing, acting without expectations,

功成而弗居，夫唯弗居，

Succeeding without taking credit, the disciple must not take credit,

是以不去。

So that credit never leaves him.
