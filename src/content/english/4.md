道冲而用之或不盈，

The Way soars and consumes, without filling.

渊兮似万物之宗。

So deep as to be the ancestor of the myriad things.

挫其锐，解其纷，

It blunts sharpness, untangles knots,

和其光，同其尘。

Softens the glare, combines the elements.

湛兮似或存，

So profound as to possibly have a remainder.

吾不知谁之子，

I do not know what it is,

象帝之先。

It appeared before God.
