道冲而用之或不盈，

The Way is so vast that when you use it, something is always left.

渊兮似万物之宗。

How deep it is! It seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things.

挫其锐，解其纷，

It blunts sharpness, untangles knots

和其光，同其尘。

Softens the glare, unifies with the mundane.

湛兮似或存，

It is so full! It seems to have remainder.

吾不知谁之子，

It is the child of I-don't-know-who.

象帝之先。

And prior to the primeval Lord-on-high.
