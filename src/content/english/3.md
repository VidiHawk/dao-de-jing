不尚贤，使民不争，

Not adulating the worthy, makes people non-contentious.

不贵难得之货，使民不为盗。

Not valuing hard-to-get goods, makes people refrain from stealing.

不见可欲， 使民心不乱。

Not seeing what can be desired, appeases people's soul.

是以圣人之治，

Thus, governs the sage,

虚其心，实其腹， 弱其志，强其骨。

Clear people's minds, set right their bossoms, weaken their ambitions and strengthen their bones.

常使民无知无欲， 使夫智者不敢为也，

Always keep the people ignorant and devoid of desire, make the cunning ones dare not agitate the rest.

为无为，则无不治。

Act without contrivance, thus is the principle of absolute governance.
