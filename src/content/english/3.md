不尚贤，使民不争，

If you do not adulate the worthy, you will make others non-contentious.

不贵难得之货，使民不为盗。

If you do not value rare treasures, you will stop others from stealing.

不见可欲， 使民心不乱。

If people do not see desirables, they will not be agitated.

是以圣人之治，

Therefore, when the sage governs,

虚其心，实其腹， 弱其志，强其骨。

He clears people's minds, Fills their bellies, Weakens their ambition and
Strengthens their bones.

常使民无知无欲， 使夫智者不敢为也，

If the people are kept without cleverness and desire It will make the
intellectuals not dare to meddle.

为无为，则无不治。

Acting without contrivance, there is no lack of manageability.
