五色令人目盲，

Too many colors render people blind,

五音令人耳聋，

Too many sounds render people deaf,

五味令人口爽，

Too many flavors dull the palate,

驰骋畋猎令人心发狂，

Racing and hunting madden the mind,

难得之货令人行妨。

Hard-to-get goods makes people misbehave.

是以圣人为腹不为目，

Therefore the sage provides for the soul, not for the senses.

故去彼取此。

Thus let go of this, takes up that.
