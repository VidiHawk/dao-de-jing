古之善为士者，微妙玄通，深不可识。

The ancient masters of the way had subtle marvelous mystic penetration; a depth that cannot be known.

夫唯不可识，故强为之容。

The disciple solely can not know, hence he is forced to pay attention to its appearance.

豫焉若冬涉川，

Apprehend it akin to wade across a river in the winter.

犹兮若畏四邻，

Just like one afraid of his neighbors on all sides.

俨兮其若容，

Respectful, towards its outer appearance.

涣兮若冰之将释，

Like ice, ever melting away before revealing itself.

敦兮其若朴，

Considerate towards its simplicity.

旷兮其若谷，混兮其若浊。

Open, like a valley. Obscure, like muddy water.

孰能浊以静之徐清？

Who can be muddled, and use clarity to gradually become lucid?

孰能安以久动之徐生？

Who can be calm, and use constant application for eventual success?

保此道者不欲盈，

The one who holds to this path does not crave fulfillment.

夫唯不盈，故能蔽不新成。

Precisely because he does not crave fulfillment, can he preserve himself and avoid the lure of new accomplishment.
