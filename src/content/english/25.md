有物混成，先天地生。

As part chaotic formation of matter, the primal universe was born.

寂兮寥兮，独立不改。

So silent and desolate! Selfstanding and invariable.

周行而不殆，可以为天下母。

Once it revolved safely, could the earth be created.

吾不知其名，字之曰道，

I don't know its name. As a word, I label it the “way”.

强为之名曰大。

Imposing on it a name, I call it “great.”

大曰逝，逝曰远，

Greatness encompasses the passing of time, the passing of time encompasses the distant,

远曰反。

The distant entails return.

故道大，天大，

Hence, the way is great, the universe is great,

地大，王亦大。

The earth is great, and the human is also great.

域中有四大，而王居其一焉。

Within our realm there are four greatnesses and the human being is one of them.

人法地，地法天，

Human beings are ruled by the earth, earth is ruled by the cosmos.

天法道，道法自然。

The cosmos is ruled by the way, the way is ruled by nature.
