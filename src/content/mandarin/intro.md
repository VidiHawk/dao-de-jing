##### ABOUT THIS APP:

The <b>Dao de Jing</b> by <b>Lao Zi</b> is arguably among the most important piece of text ever written. Not fully satisfied with existing translations, I am proposing here a new translation in an format that facilitates learning. The Chinese version is written in simplified characters for the sake of modernity.
