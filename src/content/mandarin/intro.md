##### ABOUT THIS APP:

Hi, I am Fabian de Mortier, and I consider the <b>Dao de Jing</b> by <b>Lao Zi</b> to be the most interesting poem ever written. Not fully satisfied with existing translations, I am proposing here a new translation in an format that facilitates learning. The Chinese version is written in simplified characters for the sake of modernity. If you have any comments, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:info@fabiandemortier.com" style="color:#bbc2fc">email.</a>
