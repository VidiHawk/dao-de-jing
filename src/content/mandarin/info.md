#### 3. About this app's author:

Hi, I am Fabian de Mortier. I could not find any practical resource to learn the Dao de Jing while being on-the-go. So one week-end, I decided to code a simple app. I showed it to some friend and they wanted to use it, so I deployed it online for the benefit of all. It hasn't been fully tested yet, and if you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:info@fabiandemortier.com" style="color:#bbc2fc">email.</a> For more info about me, visit <a href="https://www.fabiandemortier.com" style="color:#bbc2fc">www.fabiandemortier.com</a>

#### 4. About the translation:

Dao de Jing is one of my all-time favorite piece of ancient Chinese philosophy. Not fully satisfied with existing translations, I am proposing here a new translation in an format that facilitates learning. The Chinese version is written in simplified characters for the sake of modernity.

While many existing translations digress into fanciful spiritual interpretations, I privileged a straight-forward and close-to-the-original-text translation. I attempted to keep the translation as simple and logical as possible, in order to make it easier for learners that have limited knowledge of Taoist concepts. This will leave readers plenty of room to make their own interpretation.

For those who want to dive deeper into the topic, <a href="https://terebess.hu/english/tao/_index.html" style="color:#bbc2fc">here is a database</a> with no less than 136 different translations of the Dao de Jing!

#### 5. About Dao de Jing:

The <b>Dao de Jing</b> is arguably among the most important pieces of text ever written in history. It is a beautiful classic poem of about 5,000 characters organized in 81 chapters. The Dao de Jing is traditionally credited to the 6th-century BC sage <b>Lao Zi</b>. The text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are still debated. The Dao de Jing is a poetic description of the functioning of our universe, and of the human condition. It is for millions of people around the world an endless source of inspiration.
