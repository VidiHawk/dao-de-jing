# Dao de Jing

### Bugs

- none at the moment!

### Next steps

- add a PWA install button in Settings: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/creating-a-browser-agnostic-pwa-install-button-41039f312fbe 
- SEO https://www.dotcms.com/blog/post/single-page-applications-seo-how-to-get-it-right
- optimize font loading https://microwork.dev/optimize-google-fonts-to-fix-eliminate-render-blocking-issues/. I did convert KaiTi from .ttf to .woff2 with https://transfonter.org/. The file size went from 11MB to 3.8MB, but this is still too much so I deactivated the fonts on the app.

### Golden Ratio

Key design elements of this app are sized according to the golden ratio Ï†.
