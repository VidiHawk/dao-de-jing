# Dao de Jing

### Bugs

- Audio doesn't work on iPhone on both Chrome and Safari.
- Audio sometimes replays twice the same track
- add ScrollToView to the Audiolist.
- optimize font loading https://microwork.dev/optimize-google-fonts-to-fix-eliminate-render-blocking-issues/. I did convert KaiTi from .ttf to .woff2 with https://transfonter.org/. The file size went from 11MB to 3.8MB, but this is still too much so I deactivated the fonts on the app.
- responsive design on Apple devices.

### Next steps

- add additional information on the Dao de Jing and the app on the loading page
- make it a PWA https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/
- SEO https://www.dotcms.com/blog/post/single-page-applications-seo-how-to-get-it-right

### Golden Ratio
